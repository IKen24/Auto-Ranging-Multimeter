# This is Our Digital Electronics Project

## Instructions for Setup
1. Make sure you have git installed on your machine (laptop, PC, or whatever you are using)
2. Once you have git installed, make a github account (Steps 1 and 2 can be done in any order)
3. In github, in the directory, press the code button. Copy the URL.
4. Open a command terminal. Navigate to the folder where you want the project to be.
5. Write the command **git clone <url>**.

Congratulations. You have the project set up.

## Updating code
- If you want to submit your code changes run the following commands:
1. git add . or git add [Name of File With Edit]
2. git commit -m "a message of some sort"
3. git push.

**N.B.**
If you make changes, let the other members of the team know. 

## Code structuring
Write any functions that your task requires in a seperate .cpp file, and do not write a main method in this file
Write a .hpp header file for the functions implemented, and include that in main

**Any pushes to the main branch should have no function specific code in the main method, until it is agreed by the team**

## Fetching other people's code
Run git pull.

Git is pretty confusing at first, at middle and at end. So, any questions or confusion should be mentioned in the group chat as soon as it arises.

*Happy Coding*

P.S. To open terminal go Ctrl + ' in mbed
